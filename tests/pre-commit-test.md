# Test file for mdslw sentence wrapping

This is a test paragraph with multiple sentences. It should remain unchanged without the --wrap-sentences flag. This demonstrates the default behavior.

When sentence wrapping is enabled, each sentence will be on its own line. This makes version control diffs easier to read! You can configure the behavior with various options.
